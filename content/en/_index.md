## Welcome to my Digital Garden

Hi, I'm Hazem Shaban, an IT Engineering Graduate, Linux and DevOps enthusiast.

This website serves as my personal knowledge base â€“ a digital garden where I cultivate notes, document experiments, and share insights gained throughout my journey in the world of Linux, open-source software, and various Tech fields.

**My focus areas include:**

*   **Linux:** Distros, commands, tools, window managers, etc.
*   **Tools and Commands:** Bash, Git, Vim, Tmux, SSH, Rsync and many more waiting to be **discovered**.
*   **Programming:** Sailing in various programming languages and framework.
*   **Virtualization & Containerization:** KVM (I previously used VirtualBox and VMware before settling on KVM), Docker, and occasionally Podman.
*   **Automation:** Learning and applying Bash scripting and Ansible.
*   **Exploring FOSS:** Investigating and implementing open-source solutions.

**What you'll find here:**

*   **[Blog](/blog):** A collection of personal stories, reflections, and updates on my journey.
*   **[Experiments](/experiments):** Detailed write-ups of practical explorations.
*   **[Projects](/projects):** Overviews academic and (*hopefully*) real world projects.
*   **[Notes](/notes):** Curated notes and quick references on various technical topics.

Feel free to explore the sections. I hope you find something useful or interesting!
